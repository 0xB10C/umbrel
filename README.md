# ‚òÇÔ∏è compose

Compose is a framework for orchestration of all containerized services running on [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os).

It is platform and architecture-agnostic, thus can be used to directly spin up instances of Umbrel without installing the [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os) since all orchestrated services use multi-architecture images.

We run it on Raspbery Pis (ARMv7) as a part of [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os), Ubuntu (x64) for [testnet.getumbrel.com](https://testnet.getumbrel.com) and macOS (x64) for local development.

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are looking to run Umbrel on your hardware, you do not need to use this framework on it's own. Just download [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/releases) and you're good to go.

## üéπ Services orchestrated by Compose

- [`bitcoind`](https://github.com/getumbrel/docker-bitcoind)
- [`lnd`](https://github.com/getumbrel/docker-lnd)
- [`nginx`](https://github.com/nginx/nginx)
- [`umbrel-dashboard`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-dashboard)
- [`umbrel-manager`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-manager)
- [`umbrel-middleware`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-middleware)

## üõ† Using Compose

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Python 3.0+](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-using-pip) (installed via python3 pip)
- [Tor](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en) (using default system paths)

Ensure that your account is [correctly permissioned to use docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

### Step 1. Run this from your home directory (if installing on dedicated hardware)

> It will clone this repo while preserving home directory's existing structure.

```bash
# Ideally you should run this in $HOME as the docker-compose presets are in home
# This will not overwrite any other files but you should segment this in its 
# own account
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getumbrel/umbrel-compose/master/install-box.sh" | sh
# OR wget (if this works better)
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getumbrel/umbrel-compose/master/install-box.sh" | sh
```

### Step 2. Configure

```bash
# If you want to use testnet, otherwise it will use mainnet by default and be #reckless
export TESTNET=true
# (testnet mode not fully supported)

# Run this in the $HOME directory
./configure-box.sh
```

### Step 3. Run the services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Verify the services
docker ps -a
```

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in early development and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
